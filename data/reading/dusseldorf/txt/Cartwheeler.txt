Düsseldorf, a vibrant and culturally rich city in Germany has become known for its dynamic art scene and iconic landmarks. One of the most recognizable and beloved statues in the city is the Cartwheeler, also known as the 'Kötterschenk,' located in front of the Düsseldorf City Hall. This unique statue attracts thousands of visitors each year, but many are unaware of the rich history and significance behind its creation.

The Cartwheeler statue was created in 1972 by the famous German sculptor Bert Gerresheim. It depicts a man performing a cartwheel, with his arms outstretched and a look of pure joy on his face. The statue is made of bronze and stands at an impressive 3.5 meters tall. But why was this particular pose chosen for this iconic statue?

The history of the Cartwheeler dates back to the 15th century when the city of Düsseldorf was under the rule of Jan Wellem, a local prince. Jan Wellem was known for his love of the arts and commissioned a poem, titled 'The Cartwheeler,' to be written for him. The poem tells the story of a young boy who performs cartwheels in front of the prince's palace, impressing him with his athletic ability. The prince then rewards the boy with a gold coin, making him the happiest person in the city.

This legend became a beloved folktale in Düsseldorf and inspired Bert Gerresheim to create the iconic statue. Gerresheim was known for his love of depicting scenes of everyday life in his sculptures, and the Cartwheeler was no exception. Through this statue, he wanted to capture the spirit and joy of the city's people, who were known for their carefree and friendly nature.

Aside from its cultural significance, the Cartwheeler also serves as a symbol of hope and optimism for the city. It was unveiled during a time of economic and political turmoil in Germany, and the statue served as a reminder to the people of Düsseldorf to never lose their love for life and to always find joy in the simplest of things.

The Cartwheeler has also become an important part of the city's identity and has been featured on various souvenirs, postcards, and tourism material. It is also often used as a symbol of the city's carnival, with people dressing up as the Cartwheeler during the celebrations.

Over the years, the Cartwheeler statue has undergone some changes. In the early 2000s, a new version of the statue was created, and the original was moved to the courtyard of the City Museum. However, due to public demand, the original statue was restored to its original spot in front of the City Hall in 2013, where it continues to delight and inspire visitors to the city.

In conclusion, the Cartwheeler statue in Düsseldorf is not just a sculpture; it is a symbol of the city's history, culture, and spirit. Its creation was inspired by a folktale that captured the hearts and imaginations of the people in Düsseldorf, and it continues to do so to this day. So, the next time you visit this vibrant city, don't forget to take a moment to admire and appreciate the Cartwheeler statue and the rich history behind it.
