Hi everyone, I'm Schmit with you and today is our last episode of the Düsseldorf neighborhood show. Lastly we will discuss the two neighborhoods of Derendorf and Kaiserswerth.


**7. Derendorf:**
Just north of Pempelfort is the neighborhood of Derendorf, seen as one of the next up-and-coming boroughs of the city. Home to many university faculties, Derendorf has a booming student population, which has made it a popular place to live for the city’s younger population. This rise in student residents has also had another effect on Derendorf, an increase in nightlife.
Derendorf’s reputation as one of Dusseldorf’s premier nightlife has been born out of its closeness to the city center, while still retaining its low-key vibe. Balancing out its nightlife is its reputation as being home to many national and international companies in Germany. Companies such as L’Oréal Deutschland, McKinsey & Company Inc, Deloitte Consulting GmbH, Metro AG, and TK Maxx all have their head offices based in the Derendorf neighborhood.  
Over the past couple of decades, Derendorf has become a central neighborhood for Dusseldorf and Germany’s ever-growing Turkish community. The community has grown into one of the largest Turkish diasporas in western Germany, with Derendorf being home to the city’s central mosque. This Turkish influx has given Derendorf a truly multicultural feel, one that can be seen in the booming Turkish culinary scene throughout the neighborhood, only adding to its unique feel.



**9. Kaiserswerth:**
Kaiserswerth is one of the oldest areas of the city and also one of the most sought after. It enjoys an envious location by the River Rhine and is regarded as one of the most picturesque parts of the city with its beautiful houses and green avenues. The most attractive landmark of this historic city is the Kaiserpfalz, the ruins of the seat of the Holy Roman Empire in the early 11th century. Kaiserswerth’s other claim to fame is the Deaconess’s Institute of Kaiserswerth where Florence Nightingale worked. Historic churches and architecture, cozy beer gardens and the possibility to embark on a river cruise make Kaiserswerth a great day trip for tourists and locals alike.

This is the end of our show. I have enjoyed exploring our beloved Düsseldorf with you. Thank you all and have a good evening.
