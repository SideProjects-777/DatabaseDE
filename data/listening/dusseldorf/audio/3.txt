Good evening, everyone. And so I'd like to welcome you to the third installment of our show. It's Schmidt again. Our third episode will consist of the three following neighborhoods - Bilk, Unterbilk and Oberbilk. Make yourselves comfortable, we're about to begin.


**8. Bilk:**
Home to the Heinrich-Heine-University, Bilk is a preferred neighborhood for young crowds. This charming green locality has several interesting restaurants, cafés and nightclubs, but is also a great spot to soak up some history and culture. The oldest church of Dusseldorf, Alte Bilker Kirche, stands a proud testimony to the changing times alongside the relaxing green oasis of Botanic Gardens. The award-winning City Gate and the Kunstsammlung, with its unbeatable collection of art, amaze visitors without exception. The Bilk also boasts of an amazing cityscape, dominated by the Rheinturm.

**5. Unterbilk:**

The neighborhood of Unterbilk is considered to be one of Dusseldorf’s biggest transformations and success stories. Made up of the historic Dusseldorf docks, Unterbilk spent most of its life as a rather run-down region of the city, relying on the booming dock economy and labor class that lived and worked here.
Over the past few years, however, Unterbilk has gone through an extravagant transformation.  Unterbilk has transformed from a dockyard neighborhood to the center of media and the creative arts. Known as a media harbor, Unterbilk has begun offering modern and central workspaces to a variety of media and creative companies, making it the heart of the media industry in Dusseldorf.
With this burst of funding and improved economic status, Unterbilk has seen a time of gentrification, which has made it one of the most desirable places to live in the city. Competition for rental properties has increased the cost of living here, yet it makes it one of the best neighborhoods in Duseelfdorf for creative types to settle.
A combination of riverside accommodation, a thriving media and arts scene, and the historical culture of Dusseldorf docks all contribute to the popularity of the Unterbilk neighborhood, and it is easy to see why.

**6. Oberbilk:**

A little further out from Dusseldorf’s city center is the neighborhood of Oberbilk. Oberbilk is home to the city’s central station, making it another ideal spot for those who want strong public transport connections to the rest of the city. Once renowned for being the epicenter of Dusselfdorf’s working-class community, Oberbilk has now grown into a neighborhood famed for its third-sector industries.
A highly popular neighborhood for ex-pats, Oberbilk’s population is 23% non-German, which is higher than the 17% found in Düsseldorf as a whole. The multicultural nature of Oberbilk has not only made it one of the best neighborhoods in Dusseldorf for ex-pats but also brought with it a melting pot of foreign culture. This takes the form of an incredible multinational food scene, including restaurants selling cuisine from Japan, Greece, Turkey and so many more.
As one of the more affordable neighborhoods in which to live in Dusselfdorf’s central district, Oberbilk is a popular neighborhood for students and younger residents looking for smaller apartments and low-budget rental properties.
