Hey, everybody, it's me Schmidt again. And today we are going to talk about Düsseldorf, specifically Flingern and Pempelfort. These are two very cool neighborhoods in Düsseldorf. So here we go.

**3. Flingern:**
Located in the east of Dusseldorf, the neighborhood of Filngern long held the status of being the city’s premier blue-collar neighborhood. Today, Filngern is divided into two different boroughs, Filngern-Nord and Filngern-Süd. This north-south divide has given Filngern two different feels to two neighborhoods, each with its own distinctive identity.
Filngern-Süd has retained the blue-collar working class routes for which the neighborhood is famous. This borough retains the factory economy, with numerous old and new factories providing work for a huge number of the neighborhood’s population. These working-class routes and endless job opportunities make Filngern-Süd one of the best neighborhoods in Dusseldorf for those looking to work in this sector. 
On the other hand, Filngern-Nord has stepped away from its working-class, blue-collar reputation and gone through a series of reinventions over the past few years. The once working-class housing has given way to a more middle-class community, many of which live in converted industrial buildings and converted warehouses.
Alongside this residential transformation, Flingern-Nord is also home to a booming student arts scene. Despite its closeness to the city center, Flingern-Nord has managed to maintain its reasonable house and apartment rental prices, again, this makes it an appealing place to settle for students as well as families.

**4. Pempelfort:**
Although Carlstadt boasts its fair share of museums, the neighborhood of Pempelfort has long been seen as the very center of Dusseldorf’s art and culture movement. Located in the north of the city’s central District One, Pempelfort has an ultra-modern feel, only boosted by the newly implemented urban building projects.
With an attractive mix of modern and Altbau-style architecture, the homes in Pempelfort instantly reflect the neighborhood’s artistic and cultured nature. Fitting in perfectly with this reputation is the splendid number of museums, theatres, and other cultural facilities that can be found in Pempelfort.
With a modern outlook on homes and housing, Pempelfort constructed the largest building project in the city, the Le Quartier Central. Le Quartier Central is made up of 140,000 sqm of flats and 311,000 sqm of office spaces. Although Pempelfort has seen a furious building program, the neighborhood still retains a number of green and pleasant spots.
Green spots in the neighborhood include a huge park that stretches up much of the eastern side of Pempelfort. This park is a popular spot for local dog walkers and those whole wish to breathe a little fresh air in the center of the city.

So the question is, were you interested? If the answer is yes, I'll be expecting you at the same time tomorrow. Thank you all and have a good evening.
