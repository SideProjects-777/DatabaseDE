Hey everyone. My name is Schmidt and today we will be talking about neighborhoods in Dusseldorf. If you are looking for an apartment, our information will be very useful for you. And so we begin:

**1. Altstadt (Old Town):**

Altstadt, translating as the Old Town, is situated in the very center of the city. Also known as Stadtmitte, meaning the city center, Altstadt happens to be the oldest neighborhood in Dusseldorf too. Although only small in comparison, spanning around half a square kilometer, Altstadt continues to captivate thousands of visitors every year.
Surrounded by the mega-city of Dusseldorf, Altstadt has managed to retain its old town feel that has passed down through the centuries. The narrow winding streets of Altstadt house an array of historic buildings that hark back to the days of ancient Dusseldorf, making it one of the most charming neighborhoods in the city.
Set along the eastern banks of the River Rhine, Altstadt allows you to be in the center of all the action, while still being able to add a little nature and natural surroundings to your home here. Popular with tourists and tourist-based businesses, Altstadt can be one of the busiest and most expensive places to live in the city. However, for those who wish to be amongst the very beating heart of the city, Altstadt makes the ideal place in which to settle. 
All in all, Altstadt is one of the best neighborhoods to live in in Dusseldorf if you want to retain a little of the old facade and feel of the city.

**2. Oberkassel:**

Lying on the western banks of the River Rhine, opposite the city center, the neighborhood of Oberkassel is seen as one of the most well-to-do areas in Dusseldorf. The perfect combination of proximity to the city center while at the same time having the idyllic river separating you from the inner city congestion only adds to Oberkassel’s popularity.
Oberkassel blends the city neighborhood perfectly with a feel of a suburban and a countryside setting, made up of a variety of different homes, from detached standalone houses to apartment buildings. These often cobblestoned streets are balanced out with a rich brown of treelined streets, bringing an idyllic greenness to the Oberkassel neighborhood.
A short walk from your home, you will also come to a huge sway of green fields on the western banks of the River Rhine. Although extremely close to the city center, this green belt of fields gives the impression that you have stepped out into the countryside. With winding, riverside trails cutting through Rhine meadows, the banks are even home to a flock of sheep – only adding to the green and countryside feel. All of this idyll makes Oberkassel one of the best places to live in Dusseldorf, but this does come at a price. Oberkassel is one of the most upmarket and expensive neighborhoods in the city, yet many would see the price worth it to live in such a nice part of the city.

I think that's enough for today, if you are interested then don't miss our tomorrow's episode at 19.00 .
